An AI agent that solves Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) IQ problems.

Background:
Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices, or RPM, is a nonverbal IQ test that relies on abstract reasoning and pattern recognition to predict fluid intelligence. The test consists of a series of 2x2 and 3x3 grids of cells containing images of black-and-white arrangements of shapes. All except one cell in the grid contain an image. The images in the grid are related to each other, which can be observed by noticing patterns and transformations in the position, size, and shape of adjacent images. The test involves selecting the image in a list of answer choices that best fits the missing cell, based on considering the surrounding patterns and transformations between nearby images.

How the agent solves RPM problems:
The problems are represented as image files containing the 2x2 and 3x3 grids of images, along with possible answer choices.
The program first binarizes these image files, so that NumPy array methods and image operations
The programmed agent (Agent.py) approaches solving the RPM problems by using bitwise image operations such as and, or, xor, and not-ratio methods such as dark pixel ratio (dpr) and intersection pixel ratio (ipr)
The problems that the agent has been tested on are divided into categories: basic, test, challenge, and Raven's. 
The agent correctly solves (35/48) of the. More detailed breakdowns of the problems and efficiency can be found in the RPM final journal pdf file.
